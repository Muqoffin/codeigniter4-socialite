## About

CodeIgniter4 Socialite is Forked from Laravel Socialite wrapper around OAuth 1 & OAuth 2 libraries for working with codeigniter4 compatibility.

## Introduction

CodeIgniter4 Socialite provides an expressive, fluent interface to OAuth authentication with Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket. It handles almost all of the boilerplate social authentication code you are dreading writing.

**We are not accepting new adapters.**

Adapters for other platforms are listed at the community driven [Socialite Providers](https://socialiteproviders.netlify.com/) website.
